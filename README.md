# C++ Learning Journey üöÄ

This repository contains my journey through C++ programming, exploring fundamental concepts through practical exercises. Each module focuses on specific C++ features and programming paradigms.

## üìö Module Overview

### CPP00 - Namespaces, Classes, Member Functions, stdio streams, Initialization lists, Static, Const

**Key Concepts Learned:**
- Basic C++ syntax and iostream usage
- Class design and encapsulation
- Member functions and constructors
- Static members and methods
- Input/output formatting

#### Exercises:
- **ex00 - Megaphone**: Introduction to C++ iostream, string manipulation, and basic program structure
- **ex01 - Phonebook**: First class implementation with private members, constructors, and user interaction
- **ex02 - Account**: Static members, timestamps, and complex class interactions

---

### CPP01 - Memory Allocation, Pointers to Members, References, Switch Statement

**Key Concepts Learned:**
- Stack vs Heap memory allocation
- Pointers and references in C++
- Dynamic memory management with `new` and `delete`
- Object lifetime and scope
- Reference semantics

#### Exercises:
- **ex00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ**: Stack vs heap allocation, constructors/destructors
- **ex01 - Zombie Horde**: Dynamic array allocation and object initialization
- **ex02 - HI THIS IS BRAIN**: Understanding pointers vs references
- **ex03 - Unnecessary Violence**: References as class members and object relationships
- **ex04 - Sed is for Losers**: File I/O and string manipulation
- **ex05 - Harl 2.0**: Function pointers and method dispatch
- **ex06 - Harl Filter**: Switch statements and program flow control

---

### CPP02 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, Orthodox Canonical Class Form

**Key Concepts Learned:**
- Operator overloading principles
- Copy constructor and assignment operator
- Orthodox Canonical Class Form (The Big Three)
- Fixed-point arithmetic
- Implicit vs explicit type conversions

#### Exercises:
- **ex00 - My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form**: Basic canonical form implementation
- **ex01 - Towards a More Useful Fixed-Point Number Class**: Type conversions and constructors
- **ex02 - Now We're Talking**: Complete operator overloading (arithmetic, comparison, increment/decrement)

---

### CPP03 - Inheritance

**Key Concepts Learned:**
- Class inheritance and the "is-a" relationship
- Protected vs private vs public inheritance
- Virtual destructors and method overriding
- Base class initialization
- Diamond problem basics

#### Exercises:
- **ex00 - Aaaaand... OPEN!**: Basic class design with encapsulation
- **ex01 - Serena, my Love!**: Single inheritance and method overriding
- **ex02 - Repetitive Work**: Multiple inheritance and method resolution
- **ex03 - Now It's Weird!**: Diamond inheritance and virtual inheritance

## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Running

Each exercise contains its own Makefile. To build and run:

```bash
# Navigate to any exercise directory
cd cpp0X/exXX

# Compile
make

# Run the executable
./program_name
```

## üìù Key Learning Outcomes

### Memory Management
- Understanding when to use stack vs heap allocation
- Proper resource management with constructors/destructors
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Encapsulation through private/protected members
- Inheritance hierarchies and polymorphism
- Proper class design following C++ best practices

### C++ Language Features
- Operator overloading for natural syntax
- References vs pointers usage patterns
- Static members for class-wide data
- Orthodox Canonical Class Form for robust classes

### Best Practices
- Const correctness
- Proper header file organization
- Memory leak prevention
- Code organization and modularity

## üîç Code Quality Standards

All exercises follow:
- **C++98 standard** compliance
- **Orthodox Canonical Class Form** where applicable
- **Proper memory management** (no leaks)
- **Consistent coding style** with clear naming conventions
- **Comprehensive error handling**

## üéØ Skills Developed

- **Problem-solving** through incremental complexity
- **Code organization** with headers and implementation files
- **Debugging** memory-related issues
- **Design patterns** in object-oriented programming
- **C++ idioms** and best practices
